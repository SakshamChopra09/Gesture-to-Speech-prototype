# Gesture-to-Speech-prototype
Gesture to speech for the dumb using MPU6050 gesture sensor and Arduino  
The project aims to help the dumb(people who cannot speak) to ease their work to express. They can express their feelings by just making gestures and those gestures can be spoken by the speaker(laptop).
# Requirements
